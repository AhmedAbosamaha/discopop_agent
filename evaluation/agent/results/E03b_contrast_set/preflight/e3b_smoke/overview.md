# Agent experiment run `e3b_smoke`

- status: finished (created 2026-10-10T12:50:26, finished 2026-10-10T13:13:19)
- host: `rms14562`, compilers `/usr/bin/clang-20` / `/usr/bin/clang++-20`
- agent: `cb921121f56cdae31ede62d3a6a3aaf64ef1ebfc` (uncommitted diff sha256 `None`)
- harness: `cb921121f56cdae31ede62d3a6a3aaf64ef1ebfc` on `agentic_DiscoPop`
- verify size `per_kernel`, threads [6, 12], repeats 5

Outcomes are judged by the harness, not by the agent: `BROKEN` means the final program's values differ from the original's (relative error > 1e-09) or move between repeats at a fixed thread count; `SCAFFOLD_MODIFIED` means the rewrite edited the packaging's own code (the timer, the perturbed-input machinery or the digest), so the trial measures nothing and is never counted as a result; `FASTER` means correct and ≥ 1.1× at some thread count.

## Main comparison: DiscoPoP alone vs DiscoPoP + agent

**MISSING — this run has no `discopop_gate` trials.** Run that arm on the same benchmarks (no model, no cost) and rebuild with `plots --runs <this>,<that>`; speedups over the sequential original alone do not show what the agent adds.
