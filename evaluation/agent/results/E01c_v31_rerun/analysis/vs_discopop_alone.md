Classes are MEASURED (T0.11, `benchmark_classes.json`): R = DiscoPoP alone reaches no verified parallel program in any of three profile draws; A = it does in the majority; D = R, and a true recurrence by design. The claim is read from R; A is the no-harm control; D the must-decline control.

Verdicts: **gained** — DiscoPoP alone reaches no verified parallel program; the agent does, and it is >= 1.1x faster; **gained-not-faster** — as gained, but the agent's program is not faster (or the kernel is too short to time); **better** — both parallel and correct; the agent's program is >= 1.1x faster than DiscoPoP alone's; **equal** — both parallel and correct; within 1.1x of each other (or not timeable); **worse** — correct, but the agent's program is >= 1.1x slower than the one DiscoPoP alone leaves; **lost** — DiscoPoP alone reaches a verified parallel program; the agent's trial does not; **neither** — neither reaches a verified parallel program; **unsafe** — the agent's final program computes different values (BROKEN); **invalid** — the agent's trial has no verdict (scaffold modified, verification/agent/profile error); **not-comparable** — both parallel and correct, but timed on another host, size or thread set: no ratio; **no-baseline** — no DiscoPoP-alone trial for this benchmark among the given runs.
A program left unchanged IS the sequential original (1.00x); the sequential original is the reference both columns are measured against, never the comparison itself.
